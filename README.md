 Flower Classification with Iris Dataset ðŸŒ¸

This repository contains a machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species: **Iris-Setosa**, **Iris-Versicolor**, and **Iris-Virginica**. The classification is performed using a pre-trained model that has been deployed in a Django web application.

 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning for flower classification using the famous Iris dataset. The dataset consists of 150 records, each with four features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The goal is to classify each iris flower into one of the three species based on these features. The pre-trained model is loaded into a Django web application, where users can input flower measurements and receive predictions in real time.

 Installation

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Django
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
  
Here's a structured template you can use for your README file on GitHub for your flower classification repository. This README includes a brief description of the project, instructions for setup and usage, and links to relevant resources.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Django
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flower-classification.git
   cd flower-classification
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Apply Django migrations:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Access the application in your browser:
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to view the web interface.

Model
The machine learning model used for classification is based on the Decision Tree algorithm. The model was trained using the Scikit-learn library and is stored as a .pkl file.

Model Path: The model is loaded from classification/classi/iris.pkl.
Species Mapping: The predicted output is mapped to human-readable labels for the iris species.
Usage
Web Interface
Open the application in your web browser.
Enter the flower measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
